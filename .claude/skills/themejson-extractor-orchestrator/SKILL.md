4. Wait for confirmation before proceeding to the final cleanup step.

### Step 8: Orphaned References Cleanup

**Skill**: `theme-orphaned-refs`

2. On confirmation, execute the orphaned refs cleanup skill. **No Figma node is required for this step.**
3. Present the result and ask: "Please check the orphaned references cleanup result. Does everything look correct? (yes/no)"

## Completion

After all steps are complete, summarize:

- Total skills executed
- Any issues or warnings encountered during extraction
- Recommendations for next steps (e.g., testing the theme, reviewing generated files)

## Guardrails

- Always wait for user confirmation before moving to the next step
- If a user reports an issue, allow them to re-run the current step with a different node
- Allow users to skip steps if they explicitly request it
- Track progress so users can resume if the session is interrupted

## Progress Tracking

Maintain a checklist during execution:

```
[ ] 1. Palette
[ ] 2. Spacing
[ ] 3. Typography
[ ] 4. Radius
[ ] 5. Shadow
[ ] 6. Custom Color Tokens
[ ] 7. Style Variations
[ ] 8. Orphaned References
```

Update the checklist after each confirmed step.
